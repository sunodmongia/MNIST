# 🔢 MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits (0–9) from the **MNIST dataset** using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

- 📊 **Dataset**: The [MNIST dataset] consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels). This dataset is created by high school students and employees of US Census Bureau.
- 🧠 **Goal**: Build an accurate classifier that can recognize digits from 0 to 9.
- ⚙️ **Approach**: Multiple models were explored — from Logistic Regression to deep learning using CNNs — with performance compared using accuracy and confusion matrices.
